Trello Card Counter is a Mozilla Firefox extension that helps Trello users increase their productivity output, while keeping the sleek and elegant design of original Trello boards.

It helps by counting the number of cards in each column and by counting the total number of cards across any Trello board. 

The interactive toggle switch allows users to switch between showing and hiding the card counts in any Trello board.
